# For Developers

While `mdbook` is mainly used as a command line tool, you can also import the 
underlying library directly and use that to manage a book. 

- Creating custom backends 
- Automatically generating and reloading a book on the fly 
- Integration with existing projects

The best source for examples on using the `mdbook` crate from your own Rust 
programs is the [API Docs].
