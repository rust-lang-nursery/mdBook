# MathJax Support

mdBook supports math equations through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).

**However the normal method for indication math equations with `$$` does not work (yet?).**

To indicate an inline equation \\( \int x = \frac{x^2}{2} \\) use
```
\\( \int x = \frac{x^2}{2} \\)
```

To indicate a block equation

\\[ \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0} x_i \\]


use

```bash
\\[ \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0} x_i \\]
```
