## mdBook 0.2.2 (2018-10-19)
[7e2e095...2c20c99](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/compare/7e2e095...2c20c99)

### Added
- ðŸŽ‰ Process-based custom preprocessors. See [the
  docs](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/for_developers/preprocessors.html)
  for more.
  [#792](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/pull/792)

- ðŸŽ‰ Configurable preprocessors.

  Added `build.use-default-preprocessors` boolean TOML key to allow disabling
  the built-in `links` and `index` preprocessors.

  Added `[preprocessor]` TOML tables to configure each preprocessor.

  Specifying `[preprocessor.links]` or `[preprocessor.index]` will enable the
  respective built-in preprocessor if `build.use-default-preprocessors` is
  `false`.

  Added `fn supports_renderer(&self, renderer: &str) -> bool` to the
  `Preprocessor` trait to specify if the preprocessor supports the given
  renderer. The default implementation always returns `true`.

  `Preprocessor::run` now takes a book by value instead of a mutable
  reference. It should return a `Book` value with the intended modifications.

  Added `PreprocessorContext::renderer` to indicate the renderer being used.

## mdBook 0.2.1 (2018-08-22)

## mdBook 0.2.0 (2018-08-02)

### Changed
- ðŸ’¥ This release changes how links are handled in mdBook. Previously, relative
  links were interpreted relative to the book's root. In `0.2.0`+ links are
  relative to the page they are in, and use the `.md` extension. This has [several
  advantages](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/pull/603#issue-166701447),
  such as making links work in other markdown viewers like GitHub. You will
  likely have to change links in your book to accommodate this change. For
  example, a book with this layout:

  ```
  chapter_1/
      section_1.md
      section_2.md
  SUMMARY.md
  ```

  Previously a link in `section_1.md` to `section_2.md` would look like this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](chapter_1/section_2.html)
  ```

  Now it must be changed to this:
  ```markdown
  [section_2](section_2.md)
  ```

- ðŸ’¥ `mdbook test --library-path` now accepts a comma-delimited list of
  arguments rather than taking all following arguments. This makes it easier
  to handle the trailing book directory argument without always needing to put
  ` -- ` before it. Multiple instances of the option continue to be accepted:
  `mdbook test -L foo -L bar`.

- ðŸ’¥ `mdbook serve` has some of its options renamed for clarity. See `mdbook
  help serve` for details.

- Embedded rust playpens now use the "stable" playground API.
  [#754](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/pull/754)

### Fixed
- Escaped includes (`\{{#include file.rs}}`) will now render correctly.
  [f30ce01](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/commit/f30ce0184d71e342141145472bf816419d30a2c5)
- `index.html` will now render correctly when the book's first section is
  inside a subdirectory.
  [#756](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/pull/756)
